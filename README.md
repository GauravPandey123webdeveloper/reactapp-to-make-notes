# React Notes Application

This is a beginner-level React application designed to facilitate note-taking functionalities for users. Users can create, save, delete, and search notes easily through an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Note Creation:** Users can create new notes by providing a title and content through a simple form or input fields.
- **Note Display:** A list of notes is displayed on the UI, visually represented as boxes containing titles and content.
- **Note Saving:** Users can save their written notes, which become visible on the UI after saving.
- **Note Deletion:** Users can delete notes, removing them from the UI.
- **Note Searching:** Users can search for specific notes using a search box. The search functionality filters notes in real-time based on the entered query.

## Technical Considerations

- **React Components:** Distinct React components for different sections, such as note form, note list, and search bar.
- **State Management:** Utilize React state to manage dynamic content like notes and search queries.
- **Event Handling:** Implement event handlers for actions like saving and deleting notes.
- **Local Storage:** Persist user notes across page refreshes using local storage.
